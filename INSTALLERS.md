Things I like to install on a new Windows box:

## Ninite ##

Ninite is awesome.  Ninite bookmarks:

* [7zip, Firefox, Flash, Putty](http://ninite.com/7zip-firefox-flash-putty/)
* [above plus: Irfanview, Keepass, LibreOffice+JRE](http://ninite.com/7zip-firefox-flash-irfanview-java-keepass-libreoffice-putty/)

## Things that aren't on Ninite, but should be ##

* [Putty](http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/putty.exe)  (right click, save)
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/download/win)
